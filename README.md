This project required me to create a rock paper scissors game, but I decided to put a twist on the game and include beloved characters from their respective universes. 

Rock Lee from Naruto for the Rock, Konan from Naruto for the Paper and Edward Scissorhands for, you guessed it, Scissors. Try it out!
